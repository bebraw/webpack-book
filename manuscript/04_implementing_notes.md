# Implementing a Basic Note Application

Given we have a nice development setup now, we can actually get some work done. Our goal here is to end up with a crude note taking application with basic manipulation operations. We will grow our application from scratch and get into some trouble. This way you will understand why architectures such as Flux are needed.

## Initial Data Model

Often a good way to begin designing application is to start with the data. We could model a list of notes as follows:

```javascript
[
  {
    id: '4a068c42-75b2-4ae2-bd0d-284b4abbb8f0',
    task: 'Learn webpack'
  },
  {
    id: '4e81fc6e-bfb6-419b-93e5-0242fb6f3f6a',
    task: 'Learn React'
  },
  {
    id: '11bbffc8-5891-4b45-b9ea-5c99aadf870f',
    task: 'Do laundry'
  }
];
```

Each note is an object which will contain the data we need including `id` and `task` we want to perform. Later on it is possible to extend this data definition to include things like note color or owner.

## On Ids

We could have skipped ids in our definition. This would become problematic as we grow our application, though. For instance if you are referring to data based on array indices and the data changes, each reference has to change too. We can avoid that easily.

Normally the problem is solved by a backend. As we don't have one yet, we'll need to improvise something. A standard known as [RFC4122](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) allows us to generate unique ids. We'll be using Node.js implementation known as *node-uuid*. Invoke

> npm i node-uuid --save

at the project root to get it installed.

If you open up Node.js cli (`node`) and try the following, you can see what kind of ids it outputs.

```javascript
> uuid = require('node-uuid')
{ [Function: v4]
  v1: [Function: v1],
  v4: [Circular],
  parse: [Function: parse],
  unparse: [Function: unparse],
  BufferClass: [Function: Array] }
> uuid.v4()
'1c8e7a12-0b4c-4f23-938c-00d7161f94fc'
```

`uuid.v4()` will help us to generate the ids we need for the purposes of this project. It is guaranteed return a unique id with a high probability. If you are interested in the math behind this, check out [the calculations at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Random_UUID_probability_of_duplicates) for details. You'll see that the possibility for collisions is somewhat miniscule.

T> You can exit Node.js cli by hitting **CTRL-C** twice.

## Connecting Data with `App`

Next we need to connect our data model with `App`. The simplest way to achieve that is to push the data directly to `render()` for now. This won't be efficient but it will allow us to get started. The implementation below shows how this works out in React terms.

**app/components/App.jsx**

```javascript
import uuid from 'node-uuid';
...

export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const notes = [
      {
        id: uuid.v4(),
        task: 'Learn webpack'
      },
      {
        id: uuid.v4(),
        task: 'Learn React'
      },
      {
        id: uuid.v4(),
        task: 'Do laundry'
      }
    ];

    return (
      <div>
        <ul>{notes.map(this.renderNote)}</ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
  renderNote(note) {
    return (
      <li key={`note${note.id}`}>
        <Note task={note.task} />
      </li>
    );
  }
}
```

We are using various important features of React in the snippet above. Understanding them is invaluable. I have annotated important parts below:

* `<ul>{notes.map(this.renderNote)}</ul>` - `{}`'s allow us to mix JavaScript syntax within JSX. In this case our function returns a list of `li` elements for React to render as a result of our `map`.
* ``<li key={`note${note.id}`}>`` - In order to tell React in which order to render the elements, we use `key` property. It is important that this is unique or otherwise it won't be able to figure out the correct order in which to render. If not set, React will give a warning. See [Multiple Components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html) for more information.

If you run the application now, you can see it almost works. There's a small glitch but we'll fix it next.

T> If you want to attach comments to your JSX, just use `{/* no comments */}`.

## Fixing Note

The problem is that we haven't taken `task` prop in count at `Note`. In React terms *props* is a data structure that's passed to a component from outside. It is up to the component how it uses this data. In the code below I extract the value of a prop and render it.

**app/components/Note.jsx**

```javascript
import React from 'react';

export default class Note extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>{this.props.task}</div>;
  }
}
```

If you check out the application now, you should see we're seeing results that are more like it. This is only start, though. Our `App` is getting cramped. It feels like there's a component waiting to be extracted.

## Extracting `Notes`

If we keep on growing `App` like this we'll end up in trouble soon. Currently `App` deals with too many concerns. It shouldn't have to know what `Notes` look like. That's a perfect candidate for a component. As earlier we'll want something that will accept a prop, say `items`, and is able to render them in a list. We already have logic for that in `App`. It needs to be extracted out.

T> Recognizing components is an important skill when working with React. There's small overhead to creating them and it allows you to model your problems in exact terms. At high level you will just worry about layout and connecting data. As you go lower in architecture you start to see more concrete structures.

A good first step towards a neater `App` is to define `Notes`. It will rely on the rendering logic we already set up. We are just moving it to a component of its own. Specifically we'll want to perform `<Notes items={notes} />` at `render()` method of `App`. That's just nice.

You probably have the skills to implement `Notes` by now. Extract the logic from `App` and push it to a component of its own. Remember to look attach `this.props.items` to the rendering logic so that our interface works as expected. I've included complete implementation below for reference.

**app/components/Notes.jsx**

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Note from './Note';

export default class Notes extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const notes = this.props.items;

    return <ul className='notes'>{notes.map(this.renderNote)}</ul>;
  }
  renderNote(note) {
    return (
      <li className='note' key={`note${note.id}`}>
        <Note task={note.task} />
      </li>
    );
  }
}
```

It is a good idea to attach some CSS classes to components to make it easier to style them. React provides other styling approaches beyond this. I've discussed them later in this book. There's no single right way to style and you'll have to adapt based on your preferences. In this case we'll just focus on keeping it simple.

We also need to replace the old `App` logic to use our new component. You should remove the old rendering logic, import `Note` and update `render()` to use it. Remember to pass `notes` through `items` prop and you might see something familiar. I have included the full solution below for completeness.

**app/components/App.jsx**

```javascript
import uuid from 'node-uuid';
import React from 'react';
import Notes from './Notes';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const notes = [
      ...
    ];

    return (
      <div>
        <Notes items={notes} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Logically we have exactly the same `App` as earlier. There's one great difference, however. Our application is more flexible. You could render multiple `Notes` with data of their own easily.

Even though we improved `render()` somewhat and reduced the amount of markup there, it's still not particularly neat. We can push the data to the `App`'s state. Besides making the code neater this will allow us to implement logic related to it.

## Pushing `notes` to the `App` `state`

As seen earlier React components can accept props. In addition, they may have state of their own. This is something that exists within the component itself and can be modified. You can think of these two in terms of immutability. As you should not modify props you can treat them as immutable. The state, however, is mutable and you are free to alter it. In our case pushing `notes` to the state makes sense given we'll want to tweak them through user interface.

In ES6's class syntax the initial state can be defined at the constructor. We'll assign the state we want to `this.state`. After that we can refer to it. The example below illustrates how to convert our notes into state.

**app/components/App.jsx**

```javascript
...

export default class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      notes: [
        {
          id: uuid.v4(),
          task: 'Learn webpack'
        },
        {
          id: uuid.v4(),
          task: 'Learn React'
        },
        {
          id: uuid.v4(),
          task: 'Do laundry'
        }
      ]
    };
  }
  render() {
    const notes = this.state.notes;

    ...
  }
}
```

After this change our application works the same way as before. We have gained something in return, though. We can begin to modify the state.

T> In earlier versions of React you achieved the same with `getInitialState`. We're passing `props` to `super` by convention. It will work without but it's a good standard to have.

## Adding New Items to Notes list

Adding new items to the notes list is a good starting point. To get started we could render a button element and attach a dummy `onClick` handler to it. We will grow the actual logic into that.

**app/components/App.jsx**

```javascript
...

export default class App extends React.Component {
  ...
  render() {
    const notes = this.state.notes;

    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.addItem}>+</button>
        <Notes items={notes} />
      </div>
    );
  }
  addItem() {
    console.log('add item');
  }
}
```

If you click the plus button now, you should see something at your browser console. The next step is to connect this stub with our data model.

### Connecting `addItem` with Data Model

React provides one simple way to modify state, namely `this.setState(data, cb)`. It is an asynchronous method that updates `this.state` and triggers `render()` eventually. It accepts data and an optional callback that is triggered after the process has completed.

It is best to think of state as immutable and modify it always through `setState`. In our cases adding new note can be done through a `concat` operation as below.

**app/components/App.jsx**

```javascript
...

export default class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    ...

    this.addItem = this.addItem.bind(this);
  }
  ...
  addItem() {
    this.setState({
      notes: this.state.notes.concat([{
        id: uuid.v4(),
        task: 'New task'
      }])
    });
  }
}
```

If you hit the button a few times now, you should see new items. It might not be pretty yet but it works.

In addition, to `this.setState` we had to set up a binding. Without it `this` of `addItem()` would point at the wrong context and wouldn't work. It is a little annoying but necessary to bind therefore.

Using `bind` at `constructor` gives us a small performance benefit as opposed to binding at `render()`. I'll be using this convention unless it would take additional effort through lifecycle hooks. In the future [property initializers](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/01/27/react-v0.13.0-beta-1.html#es7-property-initializers) may solve this issue with a neat syntax.

T> Besides allowing you to set context [bind](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind) makes it possible to fix parameters to certain values. You will see an example of this shortly.

## Editing Notes

Our `Notes` list is almost useful now. We just need to implement editing and we're almost there. One simple way to achieve this is to detect click on a `Note` and then show an input containing its state. Then when the editing has been confirmed we can turn it back to normal.

This means we'll need to extend `Note` somehow and communicate possible changes to `App` so that it knows to update the data model. In addition, `Note` needs to keep track of its edit state and show the correct element (div or input) based on that.

We can achieve these goals using a callback and a ternary expression. Here's a sample implementation of the idea:

**app/components/Note.jsx**

```javascript
import React from 'react';

export default class Note extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.finishEdit = this.finishEdit.bind(this);
    this.checkEnter = this.checkEnter.bind(this);
    this.edit = this.edit.bind(this);
    this.renderEdit = this.renderEdit.bind(this);
    this.renderTask = this.renderTask.bind(this);

    this.state = {
      editing: false
    };
  }
  render() {
    const editing = this.state.editing;

    return (
      <div>
        {editing ? this.renderEdit() : this.renderTask()}
      </div>
    );
  }
  renderEdit() {
    return <input type='text'
      autoFocus={true}
      defaultValue={this.props.task}
      onBlur={this.finishEdit}
      onKeyPress={this.checkEnter} />;
  }
  renderTask() {
    return <div onClick={this.edit}>{this.props.task}</div>;
  }
  edit() {
    this.setState({
      editing: true
    });
  }
  checkEnter(e) {
    if(e.key === 'Enter') {
      this.finishEdit(e);
    }
  }
  finishEdit(e) {
    this.props.onEdit(e.target.value);

    this.setState({
      editing: false
    });
  }
}
```

If you try to edit a `Note` now, you will see an error (`this.props.onEdit is not a function`) at the console. We'll fix this shortly.

The remainder of the code deals with events. If we click the component while it is in its initial state, we will enter edit mode. If we confirm the editing by hitting return or trigger `onBlur`, we trigger `onEdit` callback and go back to the default state.

T> It is a good idea to name your callbacks using `on` prefix. This will allow you to distinguish them quickly from other props and keep your code a little tidier.

### Adding `onEdit` Stub

Given we are currently dealing with the logic at `App`, we can deal with `onEdit` there as well. We will need to trigger this callback at `Note` while delegate the result with relevant data to `App` level. The diagram below illustrates the idea:

![`onEdit` flow](images/bind.png)

A good first step towards that behavior is to create a stub. As `onEdit` is defined on `Note` level we'll need to pass `onEdit` handler through `Notes`. So for the stub to work changes in two files are needed. Here's what it should look like for `App`.

**app/components/App.jsx**

```javascript
export default class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    ...

    this.addItem = this.addItem.bind(this);
    this.itemEdited = this.itemEdited.bind(this);
  }
  render() {
    const notes = this.state.notes;

    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.addItem}>+</button>
        <Notes items={notes} onEdit={this.itemEdited} />
      </div>
    );
  }
  ...
  itemEdited(noteId, task) {
    console.log('item edited', noteId, task);
  }
}
```

The idea is that `Notes` will return our callback the id of the note being modified and the new state of the task. We'll need to use this data soon in order to patch the state.

We also need to make `Notes` work according to this idea. It will `bind` the id of the note in question. When the callback is triggered the remaining parameter receives a value and the callback gets called.

**app/components/Notes.jsx**

```javascript
...

export default class Notes extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.renderNote = this.renderNote.bind(this);
  }
  render() {
    const notes = this.props.items;

    return <ul className='notes'>{notes.map(this.renderNote)}</ul>;
  }
  renderNote(note) {
    return (
      <li className='note' key={`note${note.id}`}>
        <Note
          task={note.task}
          onEdit={this.props.onEdit.bind(null, note.id)} />
      </li>
    );
  }
}
```

If you edit a `Note` now, you should see a print at the console.

We are missing one final bit, the actual logic. Our state consists of `Notes` each of which has an id (string) and a task (string) attached to it. Our callback receives both of these. In order to edit a `Note` it should find the `Note` to edit and patch its task using the new data.

### Understanding `findIndex`

We'll be using an ES6 function known as [findIndex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex). It accepts an array and a callback. The function will return either -1 (no match) or index (match) depending on the result.

Babel provides an easy way to polyfill this feature using `import 'babel-core/polyfill';`. The problem is that it bloats our final bundle somewhat as it enables all [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) features. Instead we'll be using more granular approach to enable just the feature we need specifically and depend on `core-js` directly. Install it first.

> npm i core-js --save-dev

You can see how it behaves through Node.js cli. Here's a sample session:

```javascript
> require('core-js/fn/array/find-index')
[Function]
> a = [12, 412, 30]
[ 12, 412, 30 ]
> a.findIndex(function(v) {return v === 12;})
0
> a.findIndex(function(v) {return v === 121;})
-1
```

We also need to attach the polyfill to our application.

**app/main.jsx**

```
import 'core-js/fn/array/find-index';
...
```

After this you can use `findIndex` against arrays at your code. Note that this will bloat our final bundle a tiny bit (around 4 kB) but the convenience is worth it.

### Implementing `onEdit` Logic

The only thing that remains is gluing this all together. We'll need to take the data, find index based on which to modify, perform the modification and finally commit it to component state through `setState`.

**app/components/App.jsx**

```javascript
...

export default class App extends React.Component {
  ...
  itemEdited(noteId, task) {
    let notes = this.state.notes;
    const noteIndex = notes.findIndex((note) => note.id === noteId);

    if(noteIndex < 0) {
      return console.warn('Failed to find note', notes, noteId);
    }

    notes[noteIndex].task = task;

    this.setState({notes});
  }
}
```

If you try to edit a `Note` now, the modification should stick. The same idea can be used to implement a lot of functionality and this is a pattern you will see a lot.

## Removing Notes

We are still missing one vital functionality. It would be nice to be able to remove notes. We could implement a button per `Note` and trigger the logic using that. We can also achieve this easily by extending edit. I'm opting for that as it's easier to implement.

If we want the laziest possible solution, we can just remove a `Note` when the user erases the entry. This might not be the best UX but it's enough for this demonstration.

**app/components/App.jsx**

```javascript
...

export default class App extends React.Component {
  ...
  itemEdited(id, task) {
    let notes = this.state.notes;
    const noteIndex = notes.findIndex((note) => note.id === id);

    if(noteIndex < 0) {
      return console.warn('Failed to find note', notes, id);
    }

    if(task) {
      notes[noteIndex].task = task;
    }
    else {
      notes = notes.slice(0, noteIndex).concat(notes.slice(noteIndex + 1));
    }

    this.setState({notes});
  }
}
```

Try erasing an input now. The new logic should kick in and get rid of the `Note`. The idea is exactly the same as earlier. We just perform a different operation over the data.

We have a fairly well working little application now. Our `App` has grown somewhat due to new logic introduced but apart from that we are doing quite fine. You should understand how props and state work by now. There's a lot more than that to React, though.

## Understanding React Components

Besides understanding how props and state work it is important to understand the concept of component lifecycle. We already touched it briefly above but it's a good idea to understand it in more detail. You can achieve most tasks in React by applying these three concepts throughout your application.

To quote [the official documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html) React provides the following `React.createClass` specific component specifications:

* `displayName` - It is preferable to set `displayName` as that will improve debug information. For ES6 classes this is derived automatically based on the class name.
* `getInitialState()` - In class based approach the same can be achieved through `constructor`.
* `getDefaultProps()` - In classes you can set these in `constructor`.
* `propTypes` - As seen above you can use Flow to deal with prop types. In `React.createClass` you would build a complex looking declaration as seen in [the propType documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html).
* `mixins` - `mixins` contains an array of mixins to apply to component.
* `statics` - `statics` contains static properties and method for a component. In ES6 you would assign them to the class like below:

```javascript
class Note {
  render() {
    ...
  }
}
Note.willTransitionTo = () => {...};

export default Note;
```

Some libraries such as `react-dnd` rely on static methods to provide transition hooks that allow you to control what happens when a component is shown or hidden. By definition statics are available through the class itself as you might guess from the code above.

Both component types support `render()`. As seen above this is the workhorse of React. It describes what the component should look like. In case you don't want to render anything return either `null` or `false`.

In addition, React provides the following lifecycle hooks:

* `componentWillMount()` gets triggered once before any rendering. One way to use it would be to load data asynchronously there and force rendering through `setState`.
* `componentDidMount()` gets triggered after initial rendering. You have access to DOM here. You could use this hook to wrap a jQuery plugin within a component for instance.
* `componentWillReceiveProps(object nextProps)` triggers when the component receives new props. You could for instance modify your component state based on the received props.
* `shouldComponentUpdate(object nextProps, object nextState)` allows you to optimize the rendering. If you check the props and state and see that there's no need to update, return `false`.
* `componentWillUpdate(object nextProps, object nextState)` gets triggered after `shouldComponentUpdate` and before `render()`. It is not possible to use `setState` here but you can set class properties for instance.
* `componentDidUpdate` is triggered after rendering. You can modify the DOM here. This can be useful for adapting other code to work with React.
* `componentWillUnmount` is triggered just before a component is unmounted from the DOM. This is the ideal place to perform cleanup (e.g. remove running timers, custom DOM elements and so on).

## React Component Conventions

As seen in the code above, I prefer to have the `constructor` first, followed by lifecycle hooks, `render()` and finally methods used by `render()`. I like this top-down approach as it makes it straightforward to follow code. Some prefer to put the methods used by `render()` before it. There are also various naming conventions. It is possible to use `_` prefix for event handlers for instance.

In the end you will have to find conventions you like and that work the best for you. I go more detail in this topic at the linting chapter as I introduce various code quality related tools. It is possible to enforce coding style to some extent for instance.

This can be useful in a team environment as it decreases the amount of friction when working on code written by others. Even on personal projects having some tools to check out things for you can be useful and lessen the amount and severity of mistakes.

## Conclusion

You can get quite far just with vanilla React. The problem is that we are starting to mix data related concerns and logic with our View components. Instead on continuing on this path we'll improve the architecture of our application by introducing Flux to it.
