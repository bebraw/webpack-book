# React and Flux

You can get far by keeping everything in components. Eventually that will become painful. [Flux application architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html) helps to bring clarity to our React applications.

Flux will allow us to separate data and application state from our Views. This helps us to keep them clean and the application maintainable. Flux was designed with large teams in mind. As a result, you might find it quite verbose. This comes with great advantages, though, as it can be straightforward to work with.

## Introduction to Flux

![Flux dataflow](images/flux.png)

So far we've been dealing only with Views. Flux architecture introduces a couple of new concepts to the mix. These are Actions, Dispatcher and Stores. Flux implements unidirectional flow in contrast to popular frameworks such as Angular or Ember. Even though two-directional bindings can be convenient it comes with a cost. It can be hard to deduce what's going on and why.

Flux isn't entirely simple to understand as there are many concepts to worry about. In our case, we will model `NoteActions` and `NoteModel`. `NoteActions` provide concrete operations we can perform over our data. For instance, we can have `NoteActions.create({task: 'Learn React'})`.

The action itself doesn't necessarily do much. At simplest level it can tell dispatcher to proceed. Or it could hit a back-end and then trigger dispatcher based on the result. This will allow us to deal asynchronous behavior and possible errors caused by that.

Once the dispatcher has dealt with the action, Stores that are listening to it get triggered. In our case, `NoteStore` gets notified. As a result, it will be able to update its internal state. After doing this it will notify possible listeners of the new state.

This completes the loop as Views listening to the Stores receive the data. They can use it to update their own state. As a result, the user interface gets refreshed.

This sounds like a lot of steps for achieving something simple as creating a new `Note`. The approach does come with its benefits. Given the flow goes into a single direction always it is easy to debug. If there's something wrong, it's somewhere within the cycle.

### Advantages of Flux

Even though this sounds a little complicated, the arrangement gives our application flexibility. We can, for instance, implement API communication, caching and i18n outside of our Views. This way they stay clean of logic while keeping the application easier to understand.

Implementing Flux architecture in your application will actually increase the amount of code somewhat. It is important to understand, minimizing the amount of code written isn't the goal of Flux. It has been designed to allow productivity across larger teams. You could say explicit is better than implicit.

### Which Flux Implementation to Use?

The library situation keeps on changing constantly. There is no single right way to interpret the architecture. You will find implementations fitting for different tastes. [voronianski/flux-comparison](https://github.com/voronianski/flux-comparison) provides a nice comparison between some of the more popular ones.

When choosing a library it comes down to your own personal preferences. You will have to consider factors such as API, features, documentation and support. Starting with one of the more popular alternatives can be a good idea. As you begin to understand the architecture you are able to make choices that serve you better.

## Porting to Alt

![Alt](images/alt.png)

In this chapter we'll be using a library known as [Alt](http://alt.js.org/). It is a flexible, full-featured implementation that has been designed isomorphic rendering in mind.

In Alt you'll deal with Actions and Stores. Dispatcher is hidden, but you will still have access to it if needed. Compared to other implementations Alt hides a lot of boilerplate. There are special features to allow you to save and restore the application state. This is handy for implementing persistency and isomorphic rendering.

### Setting Up an Alt Instance

Everything in Alt begins from an Alt instance. It keeps track of Actions and Stores and keeps communication going on. To get started, let's add Alt to our project:

```bash
npm i alt --save
```

To keep things simple, we'll be treating all Alt components as a [singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern). Using the pattern we reuse the same instance within the whole application. To achieve this we can push it to a module of its own and then refer to that from everywhere. Set it up as follows:

**app/libs/alt.js**

```javascript
import Alt from 'alt';
//import chromeDebug from 'alt/utils/chromeDebug';

const alt = new Alt();
//chromeDebug(alt);

export default alt;
```

Webpack caches the modules so the next time you import Alt, will return the same instance again.

T> There is a Chrome plugin known as [alt-devtool](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt-devtool). After installed you can connect to Alt by uncommenting the related lines above. You can use it to debug the state of your stores, search and travel in time.

### Defining CRUD API for Notes

Next, we'll need to define a basic API for operating over the Note data. To keep this simple, let's CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) it. Given Read is implicit, we won't be needing that. We can model the rest as Actions, though. Alt provides a shorthand known as `generateActions`. We can use it like this:

**app/actions/NoteActions.js**

```javascript
import alt from '../libs/alt';

export default alt.generateActions('create', 'update', 'delete');
```

## Defining a Store for `Notes`

A Store is a single source of truth for a part of your application state. In this case, we need one to maintain the state of the notes. We will connect all the actions we defined above using the `bindActions` function.

We have the logic we need for our store already at `App`. Next, we will move that logic to `NoteStore`.

### Setting Up a Skeleton

As a first step we can set up a skeleton for our Store. We can fill in the methods we need after that. Alt uses standard ES6 classes so it's the same syntax as we saw earlier with React components. Here's a starting point:

**app/stores/NoteStore.js**

```javascript
import uuid from 'node-uuid';
import alt from '../libs/alt';
import NoteActions from '../actions/NoteActions';

class NoteStore {
  constructor() {
    this.bindActions(NoteActions);

    this.notes = [];
  }
  create(note) {

  }
  update({id, task}) {

  }
  delete(id) {

  }
}

export default alt.createStore(NoteStore, 'NoteStore');
```

We call `bindActions` to map each action to a method by name. We trigger the appropriate logic at each method based on that. Finally, we connect the Store with Alt using `alt.createStore`.

Note that assigning a label to a store (`NoteStore` in this case) isn't required. It is a good practice as it protects the code against minification and possible collisions. These labels become important when we persist the data.

### Implementing `create`

Compared to the earlier logic `create` will generate an id for a `Note` automatically. This is a detail that can be hidden within the store.

```javascript
import uuid from 'node-uuid';
import alt from '../libs/alt';
import NoteActions from '../actions/NoteActions';

class NoteStore {
  constructor() {
    ...
  }
  create(note) {
    const notes = this.notes;

    note.id = uuid.v4();

    this.setState({
      notes: notes.concat(note)
    });
  }
  ...
}

export default alt.createStore(NoteStore, 'NoteStore');
```

To keep the implementation clean we are using `this.setState`. It is a feature of Alt that allows us to signify that we are going to alter the Store state. Alt will signal the change to possible listeners.

### Implementing `update`

`update` follows the earlier logic apart from some renaming. Most importantly we commit the new state through `this.setState`:

```javascript
...

class NoteStore {
  ...
  update({id, task}) {
    let notes = this.notes;
    const noteIndex = this.findNote(id);

    if(noteIndex < 0) {
      return;
    }

    notes[noteIndex].task = task;

    this.setState({notes});
  }
  delete(id) {

  }
  findNote(id) {
    const notes = this.notes;
    const noteIndex = notes.findIndex((note) => note.id === id);

    if(noteIndex < 0) {
      console.warn('Failed to find note', notes, id);
    }

    return noteIndex;
  }
}

export default alt.createStore(NoteStore, 'NoteStore');
```

We have one final operation left, `delete`.

### Implementing `delete`

`delete` is straightforward. Seek and destroy, as earlier, and remember to commit the change:

```javascript
...

class NoteStore {
  ...
  delete(id) {
    const notes = this.notes;
    const noteIndex = this.findNote(id);

    if(noteIndex < 0) {
      return;
    }

    this.setState({
      notes: notes.slice(0, noteIndex).concat(notes.slice(noteIndex + 1))
    });
  }
  findNote(id) {
    ...
  }
}

export default alt.createStore(NoteStore, 'NoteStore');
```

It would be possible to operate directly on data. For example a oneliner such as `this.notes.splice(targetId, 1)` would work for `delete`. It is recommended that you use `setState` with Alt to keep things clean and easy to understand.

We have almost integrated Flux to our application now. We have a set of Actions that provide an API for manipulating `Notes` data. We also have a Store for actual data manipulation. We are missing one final bit - integration with our View. It will have to listen to the Store and be able to trigger Actions to complete the cycle.

T> The current implementation is naive in that it doesn't validate parameters in any way. It would be a very good idea to validate the object shape to avoid incidents during development. [Flow](http://flowtype.org/) based gradual typing provides one way to do this. Alternatively, you could write nice tests. That's a good idea regardless.

## Gluing It All Together

Gluing this all together is a little complicated as there are multiple concerns to take care of. Dealing with Actions is going to be easy. For instance, to create a Note, we would need to trigger `NoteActions.create({task: 'New task'})`. That would cause the associated Store to change and, as a result, all the components listening to it.

Our `NoteStore` provides two methods in particular that are going to be useful. These are `NoteStore.listen` and `NoteStore.unlisten`. They will allow Views to subscribe to the state changes.

As you might remember from the earlier chapters, React provides a set of lifecycle hooks. We can subscribe to `NoteStore` within our View at `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount`. By unsubscribing, we avoid possible memory leaks.

Based on these ideas we can connect `App` with `NoteStore` and `NoteActions`:

**app/components/App.jsx**

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Notes from './Notes.jsx';
import NoteActions from '../actions/NoteActions';
import NoteStore from '../stores/NoteStore';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.storeChanged = this.storeChanged.bind(this);
    this.state = NoteStore.getState();
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    NoteStore.listen(this.storeChanged);
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    NoteStore.unlisten(this.storeChanged);
  }
  storeChanged(state) {
    this.setState(state);
  }
  render() {
    const notes = this.state.notes;

    return (
      <div>
        <button className='add-note' onClick={this.addNote}>+</button>
        <Notes items={notes}
          onEdit={this.editNote} onDelete={this.deleteNote} />
      </div>
    );
  }
  addNote() {
    NoteActions.create({task: 'New task'});
  }
  editNote(id, task) {
    NoteActions.update({id, task});
  }
  deleteNote(id) {
    NoteActions.delete(id);
  }
}
```

As we alter `NoteStore` through actions, this leads to a cascade that causes our `App` state update through `setState`. This in turn will cause the component to `render`. That's Flux unidirectional flow in practice.

We actually have more code now than before, but that's okay. `App` is a little neater and it's going to be easier to develop as we'll soon see. Most importantly we have managed to implement the Flux architecture for our application.

### What's the Point?

Even though integrating Alt took a lot of effort, it was not all in vain. Consider the following questions:

1. Let's say we wanted to persist the notes within `localStorage`, where would you implement that? It would be natural to plug that into our `NoteStore`. Alternatively we could do something more generic as we'll be doing next.
2. What if we had many components relying on the data? We would just consume `NoteStore` and display it, however we want.
3. What if we had many, separate Note lists for different type of tasks? We could set up another Store for tracking these lists. That Store could refer to actual Notes by id. We'll do something like this in the next chapter as we generalize the approach.

This is what makes Flux a strong architecture when used with React. It isn't hard to find answers to questions like these. Even though there is more code, it is easier to reason about. Given we are dealing with a unidirectional flow we have something that is simple to debug and test.

## Implementing Persistency over `localStorage`

We will modify our implementation of `NoteStore` to persist the data on change. This way we don't lose our data after a refresh. One way to achieve this is to use [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage). It is a well supported feature that allows you to persist data to the browser.

### Understanding `localStorage`

`localStorage` has a sibling known as `sessionStorage`. `sessionStorage` loses its data when browser is closed, `localStorage` doesn't. They both share [the same API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API) as discussed below:

* `storage.getItem(k)` - Returns stored string
* `storage.removeItem(k)` - Removes data matching to key
* `storage.setItem(k, v)` - Stores given value using given key
* `storage.clear()` - Empties storage contents

Note that it is convenient to operate on the API using your browser developer tools. For instance, in Chrome you can see the state of the storages through the *Resources* tab. *Console* tab allows you to perform direct operations on the data. You can even use `storage.key` and `storage.key = 'value'` shorthands for quick modifications.

`localStorage` and `sessionStorage` can use up to 10 MB of data combined. Even though they are well supported, there are certain corner cases with interesting failures. These include running out of memory at Internet Explorer (fails silently) and failing altogether at Safari private mode. It is possible to work around these glitches, though.

T> You can support Safari private mode by trying to write into `localStorage` first. If that fails, you can use in-memory store instead or just let the user know about the situation. See [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14555347/html5-localstorage-error-with-safari-quota-exceeded-err-dom-exception-22-an) for details.

### Implementing a Wrapper for `localStorage`

To keep things simple and manageable, we can implement a little wrapper for `storage`. It will wrap all of these complexities. The API expects strings.

As objects are convenient, we'll use `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` for serialization. We need just `storage.get(k)` and `storage.set(k, v)` as seen in the implementation below:

**app/libs/storage.js**

```javascript
export default {
  get: function(k) {
    try {
      return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(k));
    }
    catch(e) {
      return null;
    }
  },
  set: function(k, v) {
    localStorage.setItem(k, JSON.stringify(v));
  }
};
```

The implementation could be generalized further. You could convert it into a factory (`(storage) => {...}`) and make it possible to swap the storage. Now we are stuck with `localStorage` unless we change the code.

T> We're operating with `localStorage` directly to keep the implementation simple. An alternative would be to use [localForage](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage) to hide all the complexity. You could even integrate it behind our interface.

### Persisting Application Using `FinalStore`

Besides this little utility, we'll need to adapt our application to use it. Alt provides a built-in store called `FinalStore` which is perfect for this purpose. We can persist the entire state of our application using `FinalStore`, bootstrapping and snapshotting. `FinalStore` is a store that listens to all existing stores. Every time some store changes, `FinalStore` will know about it. This makes it ideal for persistency.

We can take a snapshot of the entire app state and push it to `localStorage` every time `FinalStore` changes. That solves one part of the problem. Bootstrapping solves the remaining part as `alt.bootstrap` allows us to set state of the all stores. In our case, we'll fetch the data from `localStorage` and invoke it to populate our stores. This is handy for other cases as well. The data can come from elsewhere, through a WebSocket for instance.

T> An alternative way would be to take a snapshot only when the window gets closed. There's a Window level `beforeunload` hook that could be used. The problem with this approach is that it is brittle. What if something unexpected happens and the hook doesn't get triggered for some reason? You'll lose data.

In order to integrate this idea to our application we will need to implement a little module to manage it. We take the possible initial data into account there and trigger the new logic.

*app/libs/persist.js*  does the hard part. It will set up a `FinalStore`, deal with bootstrapping (restore data) and snapshotting (save data). I have included an escape hatch in form of `debug` flag. If it is set, the data won't get saved to `localStorage`. The reasoning is that by doing this you can set the flag (`localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true')`), hit `localStorage.clear()` and refresh the browser to get a clean slate. The implementation below illustrates these ideas:

**app/libs/persist.js**

```javascript
import makeFinalStore from 'alt/utils/makeFinalStore';

export default function(alt, storage, storeName) {
  const finalStore = makeFinalStore(alt);

  try {
    alt.bootstrap(storage.get(storeName));
  }
  catch(e) {
    console.error('Failed to bootstrap data', e);
  }

  finalStore.listen(() => {
    if(!storage.get('debug')) {
      storage.set(storeName, alt.takeSnapshot());
    }
  });
}
```

Finally, we need to trigger the persistency logic at initialization. We will need to pass the relevant data to it (Alt instance, storage, storage name) and off we go.

**app/index.jsx**

```javascript
...
import alt from './libs/alt';
import storage from './libs/storage';
import persist from './libs/persist';

main();

function main() {
  persist(alt, storage, 'app');

  ...
}
```

If you try refreshing the browser now, the application should retain its state. The solution should scale with a minimal effort if we add more stores to the system. Integrating a real back-end wouldn't be a problem. There are hooks in place for that now.

You could, for instance, pass the initial payload as a part of your HTML (isomorphic rendering), load it up and then persist the data to the back-end. You have a great deal of control over how to do this and you can use `localStorage` as a backup if you want.

W> Our `persist` implementation isn't without its flaws. It is easy to end up in a situation where `localStorage` contains invalid data due to changes made to the data model. This brings you to the world of database schemas and migrations. There are no easy solutions. Regardless, this is something to keep in mind when developing something more sophisticated. The lesson here is that the more you inject state to your application, the more complicated it gets.

## Extracting Connection Decorator

![Decorators are like matryoshkas](images/matryoshka.jpg)

Even though the application is starting to look a little better now, there's still work to be done. For instance, `App` contains plenty of store connection related logic. This isn't nice. We should extract that so it's easier to manage.

One way to achieve this is to push the logic to a decorator. Decorators are a bit like matryoshkas. These Russian dolls can contain dolls inside them. We can achieve the same with decorators.

### What Are Decorators?

If you have used languages such as Java or Python before, you might be familiar with the idea. Decorators are syntactic sugar that allow us to wrap and annotate classes and functions. In their [current proposal](https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators) (stage 1) only class and method level wrapping is supported. Functions may become supported later on.

### Implementing Logging Decorator

Sometimes it is useful to know how methods are being called. You could of course attach `console.log` there but it's more fun to implement `@log`. That's a more controllable way to deal with it. Consider the example below:

```javascript
class Math {
  @log
  add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

function log(target, name, descriptor) {
  var oldValue = descriptor.value;

  descriptor.value = function() {
    console.log(`Calling "${name}" with`, arguments);

    return oldValue.apply(null, arguments);
  };

  return descriptor;
}

const math = new Math();

// passed parameters should get logged now
math.add(2, 4);
```

This logger could be pushed to a separate module. After that we could use it across our application whenever we want to log some methods. Once implemented decorators become powerful building blocks.

The decorator receives three parameters:

* `target` maps to the instance of the class
* `name` contains the name of the method being decorated
* `descriptor` is the most interesting piece as it allows us to annotate the method and manipulate its behavior. It could look like this for instance:

```javascript
const descriptor = {
  value: () => {...},
  enumerable: false,
  configurable: true,
  writable: true
};
```

As you saw above `value` makes it possible to shape the behavior. The rest allow you to modify behavior on method level. For instance `@readonly` decorator could limit access. `@memoize` is another interesting example as that allows you to implement easy caching for methods.

### Implementing `@connect`

`@connect` will wrap our component in another component. That in turn will deal with the connection logic (`listen/unlisten/setState`). It will maintain the store state internally and then pass it to the child component that we are wrapping. During this process it will pass the state through props. The implementation below illustrates the idea:

**app/decorators/connect.js**

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const connect = (Component, store) => {
  return class Connect extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);

      this.storeChanged = this.storeChanged.bind(this);
      this.state = store.getState();

      store.listen(this.storeChanged);
    }
    componentWillUnmount() {
      store.unlisten(this.storeChanged);
    }
    storeChanged() {
      this.setState(store.getState());
    }
    render() {
      return <Component {...this.props} {...this.state} />;
    }
  };
};

export default (store) => {
  return (target) => connect(target, store);
};
```

Can you see the wrapping idea? Our decorator tracks store state. After that it passes the state to the component contained through props.

T> `...` is known as [ES7 rest spread operator](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread). It expands the given object to separate key-value pairs, or props, as in this case.

You can connect our new decorator with `App` like this:

**app/components/App.jsx**

```javascript
...
import connect from '../decorators/connect';

...

@connect(NoteStore)
export default class App extends React.Component {
  /*
  these lines can be removed now
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.storeChanged = this.storeChanged.bind(this);
    this.state = NoteStore.getState();
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    NoteStore.listen(this.storeChanged);
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    NoteStore.unlisten(this.storeChanged);
  }
  storeChanged(state) {
    this.setState(state);
  }
   */
  render() {
    const notes = this.props.notes;

    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

Note how much code this simple decorator removes from our `App`. If we wanted to add more stores to the system and connect them to components, it would be trivial now. Even better we could connect multiple stores to a single component easily.

### Decorator Ideas

We can build new decorators for various functionalities, such as undo, in this manner. They allow us to keep our components tidy and push common logic elsewhere out of sight. Well designed decorators can be used across projects.

### Alt's `@connectToStores`

Alt provides a similar decorator known as `@connectToStores`. It relies on static methods.  Rather than normal methods that are bound to a specific instance, these are bound on class level. This means you can call them through the class itself (i.e. `App.getStores()`). The example below shows how we might integrate `@connectToStores` into our application.

```javascript
...
import connectToStores from 'alt/utils/connectToStores';

@connectToStores
export default class App extends React.Component {
  static getStores(props) {
    return [NoteStore];
  }
  static getPropsFromStores(props) {
    return NoteStore.getState();
  }
  ...
}
```

This more verbose approach is roughly equivalent to our implementation. It actually does more as it allows you to connect to multiple stores at once. It also provides more control over the way you can shape store state to props.

To get familiar with more approaches we'll be using the `AltContainer` in this project. Using the decorator is completely acceptable. It comes down to your personal preferences.

## Using the `AltContainer` Instead of a Decorator

The [AltContainer](http://alt.js.org/docs/components/altContainer/) wrapper does the same thing and more. It provides a greater degree of customizability than our own solution. It's officially supported by Alt protecting us from possible API changes.

The implementation below illustrates how to bind it all together. We'll drop `@connect` from the project altogether and expand `render()` to use the `AltContainer`. After these changes we are good to go.

**app/components/App.jsx**

```javascript
import AltContainer from 'alt/AltContainer';
import React from 'react';
import Notes from './Notes.jsx';
import NoteActions from '../actions/NoteActions';
import NoteStore from '../stores/NoteStore';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button className='add-note' onClick={this.addNote}>+</button>
        <AltContainer
          stores={[NoteStore]}
          inject={ {
            items: () => NoteStore.getState().notes
          } }
        >
          <Notes onEdit={this.editNote} onDelete={this.deleteNote} />
        </AltContainer>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ...
}
```

The `AltContainer` allows us to bind data to its immediate children. In this case it injects `items` property to `Notes`. It is the same idea as for decorators earlier but now it's closer to the code. The pattern allows us to set up arbitrary connections to multiple stores and manage them.

Integrating the `AltContainer` actually grew our component a little bit. It also tied this component to Alt. If you wanted something forward-looking, you could push it into a component of your own. That facade would hide Alt and allow you to replace it with something else later on.

## Dispatching in Alt

Even though you can get far without ever using Flux dispatcher, it can be useful to know something about it. Alt provides two ways to use it. If you want to log everything that goes through your `alt` instance, you can use a snippet such as `alt.dispatcher.register(console.log.bind(console))`.

You can use the same mechanism on the Store level. In that case you would trigger `this.dispatcher.register(...)` at the constructor. These mechanisms allow you to implement effective logging to your system.

## Relay?

Facebook's [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/02/20/introducing-relay-and-graphql.html) is an interesting alternative to Flux. It improves on the data fetching department. It allows you to push data requirements to the View level.

Given it's still untested technology we won't be covering it in this book yet. Relay comes with its special requirements of its own (GraphQL compatible API). Only time will tell how it gets adopted.

## Conclusion

In this chapter you saw how to port our simple application to use Flux architecture. In the process we learned about basic concepts of Flux. We also learned to extract logic into decorators. Now we are ready to start adding more functionality to our application.
