# Building Kanban

Now that we have a nice Kanban application up and running we can worry about showing it the public. The goal of this chapter is to set up a nice production grade build. There are various techniques we can apply to bring the bundle size down. We can also leverage browser caching.

## Setting Up a Build Target

In our current setup we serve the application through `webpack-dev-server` always. To get a build done, we'll need to extend *package.json* `scripts` section.

**package.json**

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

We'll also need some build specific configuration to make Webpack pick up our JSX. We can set up sourcemaps while at it. I'll be using `source-map` option here as that's a good pick for production.

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
...

if(TARGET === 'build') {
  module.exports = merge(common, {
    devtool: 'source-map',
    module: {
      loaders: [
        {
          test: /\.jsx?$/,
          loaders: ['babel'],
          include: path.resolve(ROOT_PATH, 'app')
        }
      ]
    }
  });
}
```

After these changes `npm run build` should yield the following:

```bash
> webpack

Hash: bd3b549c6c712233167f
Version: webpack 1.10.1
Time: 4903ms
        Asset       Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
    bundle.js    1.09 MB       0  [emitted]  main
bundle.js.map    1.28 MB       0  [emitted]  main
   index.html  184 bytes          [emitted]
    + 345 hidden modules
```

1.09 MB is quite a lot. We should do something about that.

## Optimizing Build Size

There are a couple of basic things we can do to slim down our build. We can apply some minification to it. We can also tell React to optimize itself. Doing both will result in significant size savings. Provided we apply gzip compression on the content when serving it, further gains may be made.

### Minification

Minification will convert our code into a smaller format without losing any meaning. Usually this means some amount of rewriting code through predefined transformations. Sometimes this can break code as it can rewrite pieces of code you inadvertently depend upon. This is the reason why we gave explicit ids to our stores for instance.

The easiest way to enable minification is to call `webpack -p` (`-p` as in `production`). As Uglify will output a lot of these and they don't provide value in this case, we'll be disabling them. Add the following section to your Webpack configuration:

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
if(TARGET === 'build') {
  module.exports = merge(common, {
    devtool: 'source-map',
    module: {
      ...
    },
    plugins: [
      new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({
        compress: {
          warnings: false
        }
      })
    ]
  });
}
```

T> Uglify warnings can help you to understand how it processes the code. Therefore it may be beneficial to have a peek at the output every once in a while.

If you hit `npm run build` now, you should see better results:

```bash
> webpack

Hash: d3508663532b5b3565cc
Version: webpack 1.10.1
Time: 12221ms
        Asset       Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
    bundle.js     324 kB       0  [emitted]  main
bundle.js.map    2.66 MB       0  [emitted]  main
   index.html  184 bytes          [emitted]
    + 345 hidden modules
```

Given it needs to do more work, it took longer. But on the plus side the build is much smaller now.

T> It is possible to push minification further by enabling variable name mangling. It comes with some extra complexity to worry about but may be worth it when you are pushing for minimal size. See [the official documentation](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#uglifyjsplugin) for details.

### `process.env.NODE_ENV`

We can perform one more step to decrease build size further. React relies on `process.env.NODE_ENV` based optimizations. If we force it to `production`, React will get built in an optimized manner. This will disable some checks (i.e. property type checks). Most importantly it will give you a smaller build and improved performance.

In Webpack terms you can add the following snippet to the `plugins` section of your configuration:

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
if(TARGET === 'build') {
  module.exports = merge(common, {
    devtool: 'source-map',
    module: {
      ...
    },
    plugins: [
      new webpack.DefinePlugin({
        'process.env': {
          // This affects react lib size
          'NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('production')
        }
      }),
      ...
    ]
  });
}
```

This is a useful technique for your own code. If you have a section of code that evaluates as `false` after this process, the minifier will remove it from build completely. You can attach debugging specific utilities and such to your code easily this way. For instance, you could build a powerful logging system just for development. Here's a small example of what that could look like:

```javascript
if(process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  console.log('developing like an ace');
}
```

T> That `JSON.stringify` is needed as Webpack will perform string replace "as is". In this case, we'll want to end up with strings as that's what various comparisons expect, not just `production`. Latter would just cause an error. An alternative would be to use a string such as `'"production"'`. Note the "'s.

Hit `npm run build` again and you should see improved results:

```bash
> TARGET=build webpack

Hash: 37ebe639517bfeb72ff6
Version: webpack 1.10.1
Time: 10930ms
        Asset       Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
    bundle.js     264 kB       0  [emitted]  main
bundle.js.map    2.53 MB       0  [emitted]  main
   index.html  184 bytes          [emitted]
    + 339 hidden modules
```

So we went from 1.09 MB to 324 kB, and finally to 264 kB. The final build is a little faster than the previous one. As that 264k can be served gzipped, it is quite reasonable. gzipping will drop around another 40%. It is well supported by browsers.

We can do a little better, though. We can split `app` and `vendor` bundles and add hashes to their filenames.

## Splitting `app` and `vendor` Bundles

The main advantage of splitting the application into two separate bundles is that it allows us to benefit from client caching. We might, for instance, make most of our changes to the small `app` bundle. In this case, the client would have to fetch only it provided `vendor` bundle has been loaded already.

This scheme won't load as fast as a single bundle initially due to the extra request. Thanks to client-side caching, we might not need to reload all the data always. This is particularly true if a bundle remains unchanged. For instance if only `app` updates, only that may need to be downloaded.

### Defining a `vendor` Entry Point

To get started, we need to define a `vendor` entry point:

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
...

var pkg = require('./package.json');

var TARGET = process.env.npm_lifecycle_event;
var ROOT_PATH = path.resolve(__dirname);

...

if(TARGET === 'build') {
  module.exports = merge(common, {
    entry: {
      app: path.resolve(ROOT_PATH, 'app/main.jsx'),
      vendor: Object.keys(pkg.dependencies)
    },
    devtool: 'source-map',
    ...
  });
}
```

This tells Webpack that we want a separate *entry chunk* for our project `vendor` level dependencies. Webpack provides multiple ways to define chunks. Each chunk will contain a part of your application code. For example is possible to set up chunks that are loaded dynamically.

### Adding Hashing to Filenames

To make sure client-side caching works, we'll need to attach hashes to filenames. Webpack provides placeholders that are useful for this. The most useful ones are:

* `[name]` - Returns entry name.
* `[hash]` - Returns build hash.
* `[chunkhash]` - Returns a chunk specific hash.

Using these placeholders you could end up with filenames such as:

```bash
app.js?d587bbd6e38337f5accd
vendor.js?dc746a5db4ed650296e1
```

The part behind the question mark will invalidate the cache. An alternative way would be to include it to the filename itself but I find this convention to be cleaner.

We can use the placeholder idea within our configuration like this:

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
if(TARGET === 'build') {
  module.exports = merge(common, {
    entry: {
      app: path.resolve(ROOT_PATH, 'app/main.jsx'),
      vendor: Object.keys(pkg.dependencies)
    },
    /* important! */
    output: {
      path: path.resolve(ROOT_PATH, 'build'),
      filename: '[name].js?[chunkhash]'
    },
    ...
  });
}
```

If you hit `npm run build` now, you should see output like this.

```bash
> webpack

Hash: 93b7068ed91340e3f5ac
Version: webpack 1.12.0
Time: 16398ms
                             Asset       Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
       app.js?d9e6f800dcb46e3638b9     263 kB       0  [emitted]  app
    vendor.js?f6e6ad0dd8123b64e914     208 kB       1  [emitted]  vendor
   app.js.map?d9e6f800dcb46e3638b9    2.51 MB       0  [emitted]  app
vendor.js.map?f6e6ad0dd8123b64e914    2.13 MB       1  [emitted]  vendor
                        index.html  266 bytes          [emitted]
   [0] multi vendor 76 bytes {1} [built]
    + 316 hidden modules
```

This isn't quite what we expected. Both our `app` and `vendor` bundles are big. The problem is that Webpack will include all the required files in the `app` bundle. This includes the `vendor` modules.

### Setting Up `CommonsChunkPlugin`

To fix our problem, we can use `CommonsChunkPlugin`. It can extract the code we need. We can tell it what *entry chunk* to extract and how to output it. Consider the configuration:

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
if(TARGET === 'build') {
  module.exports = merge(common, {
    ...
    module: {
      ...
    },
    plugins: [
      /* important! */
      new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin(
        'vendor',
        '[name].js?[chunkhash]'
      ),
      ...
    ]
  });
}
```

If you run `npm run build` now, you should see output as below:

```bash
> webpack

Hash: 5a0cf7711f1d3fc5c930
Version: webpack 1.12.0
Time: 10565ms
                             Asset       Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
       app.js?bf777bbb05bec4070276      55 kB       0  [emitted]  app
    vendor.js?f33176572a7ad31551ee     209 kB       1  [emitted]  vendor
   app.js.map?bf777bbb05bec4070276     389 kB       0  [emitted]  app
vendor.js.map?f33176572a7ad31551ee    2.13 MB       1  [emitted]  vendor
                        index.html  266 bytes          [emitted]
   [0] multi vendor 76 bytes {1} [built]
    + 316 hidden modules
```

Note how small `app` bundle is in comparison. If we update the application now and deploy it, the users that have used it before will have to reload only 55 kB.

One more way to push the build further would be to load popular dependencies, such as React, through a CDN. That would decrease the size of the vendor bundle even further while adding an external dependency on the project. The idea is that if the user has hit the CDN earlier, caching can kick in just like here.

## Cleaning the Build

Our current setup doesn't clean the `build` directory between builds. As this can get annoying if we change our setup, we can use a plugin to clean the directory for us. Execute

```bash
npm i clean-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

to install the plugin. Change the build configuration as below to integrate it:

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
...
var Clean = require('clean-webpack-plugin');

...

if(TARGET === 'build') {
  module.exports = merge(common, {
    ...
    plugins: [
      new Clean(['build']),
      ...
    ]
  });
}
```

After this change our `build` directory should remain nice and tidy when building. See [clean-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clean-webpack-plugin) for further options.

T> An alternative would be to use your terminal (`rm -rf ./build/`) and set that up at the `scripts` of `package.json`.

## Separating CSS

Even though we have a nice build set up now, where did all the CSS go? As per our configuration it has been inlined to JavaScript! Even though this can be convenient during development, it doesn't sound ideal. The current solution doesn't allow us to cache CSS. In some cases we might suffer from a flash of unstyled content (FOUC).

As it happens Webpack provides means to generate a separate CSS bundle. We can achieve this using the `ExtractTextPlugin`. It comes with overhead during the compilation phase and it won't work with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) by design. Given we are using it only for production, that won't be a problem.

It will take some configuration to make it work. Hit

```bash
npm i extract-text-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

to get started. Next, we need to get rid of our current css related declaration at `common` configuration. After that we need to split it up between `build` and `dev` configuration sections as below:

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
...
var ExtractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin');

var pkg = require('./package.json');

var TARGET = process.env.npm_lifecycle_event;
var ROOT_PATH = path.resolve(__dirname);

var common = {
  entry: path.resolve(ROOT_PATH, 'app'),
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['', '.js', '.jsx']
  },
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(ROOT_PATH, 'build'),
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlwebpackPlugin({
      title: 'Kanban app'
    })
  ]
};

if(TARGET === 'start' || !TARGET) {
  module.exports = merge(common, {
    ...
    module: {
      loaders: [
        {
          test: /\.css$/,
          loaders: ['style', 'css'],
          include: path.resolve(ROOT_PATH, 'app')
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  });
}

if(TARGET === 'build') {
  module.exports = merge(common, {
    ...
    devtool: 'source-map',
    module: {
      loaders: [
        {
          test: /\.css$/,
          loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract('style', 'css'),
          include: path.resolve(ROOT_PATH, 'app')
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    plugins: [
      new Clean(['build']),
      new ExtractTextPlugin('styles.css?[chunkhash]'),
      ...
    ]
  });
}
```

Using this setup we can still benefit from the HMR during development. For production build we generate a separate CSS. `html-webpack-plugin` will pick it up automatically and inject it into our `index.html`.

W> Definition such as `loaders: [ExtractTextPlugin.extract('style', 'css')]` won't work and will cause the build to error instead! So when using `ExtractTextPlugin`, use `loader` form.

W> If you want to pass more loaders to the `ExtractTextPlugin`, you should use `!` syntax. Example: `ExtractTextPlugin.extract('style', 'css!autoprefixer-loader')`.

After running `npm run build` you should similar output:

```bash
> webpack

Hash: 27584124a5659a941eea
Version: webpack 1.12.0
Time: 10589ms
                              Asset       Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
        app.js?4a3890cdb2f12f6bd4d5    54.3 kB       0  [emitted]  app
     vendor.js?876083b45225c03d8a74     208 kB       1  [emitted]  vendor
    styles.css?bf777bbb05bec4070276  557 bytes       0  [emitted]  app
    app.js.map?4a3890cdb2f12f6bd4d5     389 kB       0  [emitted]  app
styles.css.map?bf777bbb05bec4070276   87 bytes       0  [emitted]  app
 vendor.js.map?876083b45225c03d8a74    2.12 MB       1  [emitted]  vendor
                         index.html  317 bytes          [emitted]
   [0] multi vendor 64 bytes {1} [built]
    + 316 hidden modules
Child extract-text-webpack-plugin:
        + 2 hidden modules
```

This means we have separate app and vendor bundles. In addition, styles have been pushed to a separate file. And on top of this we have sourcemaps and an automatically generated *index.html*.

T> If you have a complex project with a lot of dependencies, it is likely a good idea to use the `DedupePlugin`. It will find possible duplicate files and deduplicate them. Use `new webpack.optimize.DedupePlugin()` at your plugins definition to enable it.

W> Note that there's [a bug](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/1315) in Webpack preventing this feature from working correctly at the moment! I.e. if you change your application code, `vendor` hash will change!

## Isomorphic Rendering

React supports isomorphic rendering. This means you can render static HTML through it. Once the JavaScript code gets run, it will pick up the markup. Even though this sounds trivial there are some nice advantages to this approach:

* Web crawlers will be able to access the content easier (potentially better SEO)
* You can avoid requests to fetch initial data. Especially on slow connections this can make a big difference.
* The browser doesn't have to wait for JavaScript to get evaluated. Instead, it gets to render HTML straight away.
* Even users without JavaScript enabled can see something. In this case, it doesn't matter a lot, but otherwise it could be a big factor.

Even though we don't have a proper back-end in our project this is a powerful approach you should be aware of. The same idea can be applied for other scenarios such as rendering a JSX template to a PDF invoice for example. React isn't limited to the web.

We will need to perform a couple of tweaks to our project in order to enable isomorphic rendering. Thankfully *HtmlWebpackPlugin* can do most of the work for us. We just need to implement a custom template and render our initial JSX to it. Set up *index.tpl* as follows.

**templates/index.tpl**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html{% if(o.htmlWebpackPlugin.files.manifest) { %}
  manifest="{%= o.htmlWebpackPlugin.files.manifest %}"{% } %}>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>{%=o.htmlWebpackPlugin.options.title%}</title>
    {% if (o.htmlWebpackPlugin.files.favicon) { %}
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="{%=o.htmlWebpackPlugin.files.favicon%}">
    {% } %}
    {% for (var css in o.htmlWebpackPlugin.files.css) { %}
    <link href="{%=o.htmlWebpackPlugin.files.css[css] %}" rel="stylesheet">
    {% } %}
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app">%app%</div>

    {% for (var chunk in o.htmlWebpackPlugin.files.chunks) { %}
    <script src="{%=o.htmlWebpackPlugin.files.chunks[chunk].entry %}"></script>
    {% } %}
  </body>
</html>
```

This template is based on the default one used by *HtmlWebpackPlugin*. It relies on a templating library known as [blueimp-tpl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blueimp-tmpl). That's why you see all those `{% ... %}` entries there. We will inject some syntax of our own at `<div id="app">%app%</div>` next and let *HtmlWebpackPlugin* deal with the rest.

As we'll be relying on JSX when rendering, we need to rename *webpack.config.js* as *webpack.config.babel.js* first. That way Webpack knows to process it through Babel and everything will work as we expect. Besides this we need to make *HtmlWebpackPlugin* aware of our template and add our custom rendering logic there.

**webpack.config.babel.js**

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var React = require('react');
...

var App = require('./app/components/App.jsx');
var pkg = require('./package.json');

const TARGET = process.env.npm_lifecycle_event;
const ROOT_PATH = path.resolve(__dirname);
const APP_TITLE = 'Kanban app';

const common = {
  entry: path.resolve(ROOT_PATH, 'app'),
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['', '.js', '.jsx']
  },
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(ROOT_PATH, 'build'),
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  }
};

if(TARGET === 'start' || !TARGET) {
  module.exports = merge(common, {
    ...
    plugins: [
      new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin(),
      new HtmlwebpackPlugin({
        title: APP_TITLE
      })
    ]
  });
}

if(TARGET === 'build') {
  module.exports = merge(common, {
    ...
    plugins: [
      ...
      new HtmlwebpackPlugin({
        title: APP_TITLE,
        templateContent: renderTemplate(
          fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'templates/index.tpl'), 'utf8'),
          {
            app: React.renderToString(<App />)
          })
      })
    ]
  });
}

function renderTemplate(template, replacements) {
  return function() {
    return template.replace(/%(\w*)%/g, function(match) {
      var key = match.slice(1, -1);

      return replacements[key] ? replacements[key] : match;
    });
  };
}
```

We cannot use isomorphic rendering for development in this case because the generated results and front-end state may differ. This is due to the fact that `localStorage` may contain some initial data. If you had an actual back-end to develop against and you store the data there, this wouldn't be a problem.

Our isomorphic setup performs a regular expression based replacement to render our React code to `%app%`. Alternatively we could use a templating library, such as [handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars), but this solution is enough for now. Finally `React.renderToString` returns the markup we need.

T> If you want output that doesn't have React keys, use `React.renderToStaticMarkup` instead. This is useful especially if you are writing static site generators.

In addition, we need to tweak the entry point of our application to take these changes into account. When in production it should use the existing markup instead of injecting its own.

**app/index.jsx**

```javascript
...

function main() {
  persist(alt, storage, 'app');

  if(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    React.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));
  }
  if(process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
    const app = document.createElement('div');

    document.body.appendChild(app);

    React.render(<App />, app);
  }
}
```

The strange looking `NODE_ENV` checks are used to make sure dead code elimination kicks in when building the JavaScript. It will remove the entire branch from the eliminated code because the statement will evaluate as `false` in a static check performed by the minifier.

If you hit `npm run build` now and wait for a while, you should end up with `build/index.html` that contains something familiar. `npm start` should work the same way as earlier.

In this case, isomorphic rendering doesn't yield us much. If we had a back-end the situation would be different. We could serve the user markup that has the initial data and enjoy the benefits. Even though it's now more of a gimmick, it's a useful technique to be aware of.

## Conclusion

Beyond the features discussed Webpack allows you to [lazy load](https://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html) content through `require.ensure`. This is handy if you happen to have a specific dependency on some view and want to load it when you need it.

Our Kanban application is now ready to be served. We went from a chunky build to a slim one. Even better the production version can benefit from caching and it is able to invalidate it. You can also understand how isomorphic rendering works on a basic level.
